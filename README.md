# Name Checker
The purpose of this project is to take in an arbitrary csv file, and provide a clean filterable front end for interacting with it. It's intended purpose is for checking a list of names, thus the name of this application. However, I decided to make a more general purpose csv checker.


## Setup
This project is managed with npm. To run it, fork, clone, and run
```
npm i
```
to get the dependencies. To open in testing use
```
npm start
```
Once finished, build with
```
npm run build
```
Then I suggest you rename the build folder to something of your choice, and put it somewhere else so that the user doesn't have to dig to find it. This may seem like there are unnecessary steps, but for future use, this project is built assuming a web based version will eventually be made.
